}

#main-page-title {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

## The Box Model

4 Elements of the box model:

(Use Chrome Web Developer to explore!)

## CSS Best Practices
  - !important
	- no inline
	- precedence
	- external stylesheets


## Layouts & Positioning - Floats & Clear
Floats - take our elements outside of the standard flow of the webpage
```
.grand-canyon-image {
  width: 400px;
  float: left;
}
```
Use clear to make your elements 'clear' any floats and sit inline with the regular flow of the page
```
.park-info {
  clear: both;
}
```
