### Goals for Module 3
- Learn how to learn a new programming languages
- Learn how to problem solve, break things down, and work incrementally (debugging)
- Learn how to be resourceful

### JavaScript History
- Created by Brendan Eich in 1995
- Wanted to turn the web into something like a desktop application (SPA)
- Not related to JAVA (JS was first code named Mocha, then LiveScript)
- So vast...

### Intro to Javascript
- HTML (layout, content, skeleton), CSS (styling), and JS (behavior)
- Set up index.html, script.js, chrome console
- script tag at the bottom of the .html file?

### Learning a New Programming language
- How to Debug (console.log(), alert(), debugger)
- Documentation [MDN]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/))

### Difference between Ruby and JS
- type coercion
- operator precedence
- everything is an object

### Datatypes
- What types and how many?

Primitive
- number //be careful of floating point values
// Infinity, Math.PI
- boolean //true and false
// everything has a truthy or falsey value
- string //literally, interpolate, concatenation
- null //explicit absenece of data
- undefined
- symbol


Objects //{}
- arrays
- functions


- Pass by value vs pass by reference

### Rules of JS
- coercion
- pass by value or reference


### Announcements
- More Labs! Under JavaScript Foundations, labs should definitely be completed in order
